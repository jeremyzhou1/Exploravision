            The term “terraforming” was coined in the 1942 short story by author Jack Williamson, meaning ‘Earth forming’ at the time. One of the first mentions of planetary terraformation in a scientific context was made by astronomer Carl Sagan in 1961, where he described seeding the atmosphere of Venus with algae in order to convert the inhospitable conditions into one containing organic compounds. His theory was that removing carbon dioxide would trigger the greenhouse effect, consequently raising temperatures to acceptable levels. In addition, he predicted that the resulting carbon in the atmosphere would manifest itself in the form of a nonvolatile substance due to the high surface temperatures of the planet. Unfortunately, this proposition was debunked shortly after a series of discoveries about Venus during the late 20th and early 21st centuries revealed that its sulfuric acid clouds and thick atmosphere formed too volatile a combination for human inhabitance in the first place.
            However, this wasn’t enough to render the idea of terraformation obsolete; a paper on “planetary ecosynthesis” published by NASA in 1976 concluded that Mars was, in fact, capable of being made into a habitable planet. Furthermore, NASA engineer James Oberg organized the “First Terraforming Colloquium” in 1979, an event which brought together scientists of various backgrounds and levels of expertise in an effort to seriously discuss terraforming. Following the Colloquium, a number of publications were made considering terraformation; among them was Martyn J. Fogg’s series of instructive articles that helped establish definitions related to planets of varying human compatibility.
            It was not until a few years later that our current theoretical methodology was proposed; NASA’s Christopher McKay published “Terraforming Mars”, in which he alluded to releasing a vast payload of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into the Martian atmosphere in order to create what is now commonly referred to as a “self-regulating Martian biosphere”. In addition to being extremely detrimental to the ozone layer, CFCs are the most potent greenhouse gases, and are very effective when it comes to trapping heat (roughly 17,700 more effective than CO2). Releasing CFCs in large quantities would raise planetary temperatures by a few degrees - hopefully enough to spark a positive climatic reaction.
