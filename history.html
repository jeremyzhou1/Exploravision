              <p>
                  In the early 1860’s, James Clerk Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic fields and radiation, which shows that light has momentum and exerts pressure on objects,
                  created a foundation for the idea of “sailing” with light pressure. Consequently, by 1864, the the concept that sunlight could exert a force on an object and
                  spur movement was a widely accepted phenomenon.
              </p>
              <p>
                 The first significantly successful demonstration of light pressure was conducted by Ernest Nichols and Gordon Hull in 1901 by
                  precisely measuring the radiation pressure of light on a macroscopic body. Their results agreed with Maxwell's equations to better
                  than less than one percent. Though Pyotr Lebedev had conducted a similar and moderately successful experiment just 2 years before in Moscow,
                   it was far less accurate than Hull and Nichols’s measurement, with an error bound of roughly 20 percent.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Soviet rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was not only the first to propose using sunlight to move spacecraft,
                  but even made reference to the idea of a solar sail. Throughout the early 1900’s, the use of mirrors to take advantage of light
                  pressure became an idea that was constantly alluded to. In 1925, Friedrich Zander published his paper that detailed the technical aspects and
                  mechanical properties of solar sails. Within the next 4 years, this idea was further corroborated by the likes of J.B.S. Haldane and J.D. Bernal.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Since 1976, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been working on a solar sail propulsion system that would use large reflective mirrors to propel spacecraft using solar
                  radiation. This project is the first formal effort for a solar sail, and is planned to be used for a mission to rendezvous with Halley’s Comet.
