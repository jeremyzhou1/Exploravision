          <h2>Our Solution</h2>
          <p>
              Mirrors, or the layer of reflective substance that coats the sail, that are currently utilized in solar sail technology are made of aluminum,
              as exemplified by 2005â€™s Cosmos 1. Metallic mirrors pose a problem with efficiency; interaction between metals and photons induces an electromagnetic
              effect, which in turn incurs a loss in energy. Dielectric mirrors, as insulators, lack this response when struck by photons. The photons that hit
              these mirrors are reflected without any transfer or change in energy. This is ideal for use in solar sails, because solar sails, to perform at
              optimal levels, require 100% reflectivity.
          </p>
          <p>
                We propose the use of CVD diamond, a synthetic material with remarkable dielectric properties, in solar sails to increase reflectivity and
                consequently cut costs for missions. In fact, near 100% reflectivity is an easily attainable level;
                values of 99.999% can be produced using special techniques. However, current technology is incapable of taking advantage due to the limitation of
                wavelength - such reflectivity is only achievable over a narrow range. The realm of space encompasses the entire electromagnetic spectrum; encountered
                wavelength can vary immensely, and if the sail is incapable of taking advantage of a wide variety of wavelengths, in the lack of
                the specific wavelength it requires to perform optimally, the sail will not perform well.
          </p>
          <p>
              Current solar sails are comprised of aluminum surfaces. Aluminum is a strong heat conductor, which offers the solar sail extreme heat
              resistance, a quality useful when travelling near the sun. However, it falls short when it comes to efficiency - not every photon that it
              reflects is reflected and used for propulsion,
              because roughly every 1 out of 10 photons gets absorbed into the aluminum, resulting in the aforementioned loss of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
              Twenty years from now, we are hoping that diamond synthesis becomes a more fluid and quick process. Currently when creating synthetic diamond,
              the diamond is usually deposited at growth rates between 0.1 and 10 micron per hour. Improved time for
              synthesis would greatly lower costs; current costs are high because the deposition process requires a lot of energy, time, and expensive equipment.
              Furthermore, to potentially simplify the process, 3D printing technology should be expanded to printing synthetic diamonds in the future.
              In fact, the effort to make such technology is already underway; Lockheed Martin filed patent applications for a synthetic diamond printer back in 2016.
              Great improvements in both 3D printing technology to incorporate diamonds as well as an overall improvement on diamond synthesis would be valuable assets
               for making our proposition possible.

            <font color = "black">
              3 Alternative Ideas that our group had were the following: Thermonuclear weapons, Greenhouse gas factories, and utilizing microorganisms. We chose mirrors over all of these options mostly because of ethical reasons. All of these methods take long time frames; none of them would work in under 30 years (Bonsor). However, with thermonuclear weapons and greenhouse gas factories, we considered that there was a large potential for the weapons to release harmful effects into the atmosphere other than just an increase in temperature. Though raising temperatures is an issue to address, both of these would likely add further problems for human inhabitance of the planet. People may not be as willing to test-inhabit an environment on which nuclear weapons have been used.
              Microorganisms seem viable, but not enough research has been done on them to conclude them as a viable option, hence NASA has not released it as an option for its official terraformation plan (Bonsor). Mirrors most effectively deal with the issue on ethical terms while isolating global temperature as the only issue. They would minimize the probability of collateral issues as a result of tampering with the atmosphere.
