          <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            There currently exist too many obstacles to successfully terraform another planet within 20 years, but there are methods that appear viable for lunar terraformation. Of the options, a mirror seems to be the most reasonable: while it may cost more than thermonuclear bombs and may also cause high frequency radiation, it has a much better chance of being approved by an international council (Shiga). Thermonuclear bombs also run the risk of creating nuclear clouds, something that won’t be caused by mirrors reflecting the sun’s rays. Heating up the planet is also a faster method than introducing microorganisms, as the may take an extremely long period of time to go through the process of the development of life (Terraforming Earth).
          	In order to make mirrors more effective and cheaper, present carbon-carbon production techniques must first be improved. This can be accomplished in a low in-plane and through-thickness CTE of athermal design, thus allowing for a high specific stiffness and a near-zero coefficient of moisture expansion. This results in high yield and efficient reflection of sunlight to Mars, heating up the surface. In theory, this would allow for any ice on the surface to melt, releasing water and carbon. The carbon would then cause a greenhouse atmosphere to form, which is essential for human life to exist on a planet. With the existence of carbon gas, it would be possible for plant life to exist (Bonsor).
          	This process, which would take an estimated 25-50 years, may not be the most cost efficient nor the “fastest” method - compared to thermonuclear bombing, plans leading up to the creation and deployment of such a mirror might take upwards of 2 decades - but compared to the times for lingering radiation, the mirror method is much shorter.

            <h2>How We Will Design This</h2>
            <font color = "black">
              3 Alternative Ideas that our group had were the following: Thermonuclear weapons, Greenhouse gas factories, and utilizing microorganisms. We chose mirrors over all of these options mostly because of ethical reasons. All of these methods take long time frames; none of them would work in under 30 years (Bonsor). However, with thermonuclear weapons and greenhouse gas factories, we considered that there was a large potential for the weapons to release harmful effects into the atmosphere other than just an increase in temperature. Though raising temperatures is an issue to address, both of these would likely add further problems for human inhabitance of the planet. People may not be as willing to test-inhabit an environment on which nuclear weapons have been used.
              Microorganisms seem viable, but not enough research has been done on them to conclude them as a viable option, hence NASA has not released it as an option for its official terraformation plan (Bonsor). Mirrors most effectively deal with the issue on ethical terms while isolating global temperature as the only issue. They would minimize the probability of collateral issues as a result of tampering with the atmosphere.
