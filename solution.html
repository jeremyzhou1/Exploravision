          <h2>Future Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Mirrors, or the layer of reflective substance that coats the sail, that are currently utilized in solar sail technology are made of aluminum, as exemplified by 2005’s Cosmos 1.
            Metallic mirrors pose a problem with efficiency; interaction between metals and photons induces an electromagnetic effect, which in turn incurs a loss in energy.
            Dielectric mirrors, as insulators, lack this response when struck by photons.
            The photons that hit these mirrors are reflected without any transfer or change in energy.
            This is ideal for use in solar sails, because solar sails, to perform at optimal levels, require 100% reflectivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            We propose the use of CVD diamond, a synthetic material with remarkable dielectric properties, in solar sails to increase reflectivity and consequently cut costs for missions.
            In fact, near 100% reflectivity is an easily attainable level; values of 99.999% can be produced using special techniques.
            However, current technology is incapable of taking advantage due to the limitation of wavelength - such reflectivity is only achievable over a narrow range.
            The realm of space encompasses the entire electromagnetic spectrum; encountered wavelength can vary immensely, and if the sail is incapable of taking advantage of a wide variety of wavelengths, in the lack of the specific wavelength it requires to perform optimally, the sail will not perform well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current solar sails are comprised of aluminum surfaces.
            Aluminum is a strong heat conductor, which offers the solar sail extreme heat resistance, a quality useful when travelling near the sun.
            However, it falls short when it comes to efficiency - not every photon that it reflects is reflected and used for propulsion, because roughly every 1 out of 10 photons gets absorbed into the aluminum, resulting in the aforementioned loss of energy.
            Furthermore, structural integrity is key for efficiency; wrinkles or slight blemishes in material can throw off reflective efficiency due to the irregular directions in which the photons are reflected.
            CVD diamond is crucial for this purpose because it provides the structural integrity that a high reflectivity demands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twenty years from now, we are hoping that diamond synthesis becomes a more fluid and quick process.
            Currently when creating synthetic diamond, the diamond is usually deposited at growth rates between 0.1 and 10 micron per hour. Improved time for synthesis would greatly lower costs; current costs are high because the deposition process requires a lot of energy, time, and expensive equipment.
            Additionally, to potentially simplify the process, 3D printing technology should be expanded to printing synthetic diamonds in the future.
            In fact, the effort to make such technology is already underway; Lockheed Martin filed patent applications for a synthetic diamond printer back in 2016.
            Great improvements in both 3D printing technology to incorporate diamonds as well as an overall improvement on diamond synthesis would be valuable assets for making our proposition possible.

            <h2>Alternatives</h2>
            <font color = "black">
              <p>
                Amidst the plethora of changes we could have made to the current design of the solar sail, we chose CVD diamond over three alternative ideas.
                Our initial idea was to replace the typical layer of reflectance, made of aluminum, with copper. Copper has a melting point of 1085 degrees Celsius, 425 degrees higher than aluminum.
                At wavelengths higher than visible light, such as infrared, copper has a similar reflectance to aluminum. However, copper is both heavier than aluminum and has a lower reflectance for lower wavelengths.
                Thus, it cannot properly take advantage of visible light and much of the solar spectrum, resulting in a lower efficiency than aluminum.
                CVD serves a better purpose in all respects to copper.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another idea that was considered was to change the sail configuration to a spinning square shaped sail.
                The sail’s centrifugal forces would theoretically utilize the angular momentum and spin for stability in space, reducing the need for a stiff underlying support structure and thus saving mass.
                A lower mass is crucial for the speed of the sail. However, this design is untested, and the spin may cause structural failure.
                The shifts in the load carried by the sail would also destabilize the sail when continuously rotated and cause the spacecraft to weaken and potentially apart.
              </p>
              <p>
                A third possible modification to the design of the solar sail was to use carbon nanotubes to replace the usual polymer that provides both structural and mechanical support and flexibility.
                Carbon nanotubes would also satisfy the thinness and weight requirements of solar sails.
                In addition, they have the carbon-based molecular structure that gives diamond its strength.
                However, within the time frame of 20 years, CVD diamond was certainly the more viable option because unlike carbon nanotubes, synthetic diamonds is already a preexisting industry; they have been around for the better part of a century, and is less niche than carbon nanotube construction.

          <h2>Consequences</h2>
          <p>
            Using CVD diamond in present day solar sail designs would greatly benefit interstellar exploration, and open up new opportunities for transportation.
            Reducing fuel consumption is an essential component of space travel; companies face enormous expenditures per mission purely off of fuel cost and materials.
            Improving solar sails to maximum efficiency is a solution to both of these issues.
            Improved efficiency results in greater speeds of travel as well, which would quickly reduce mission time and increase data collection.
            Moreover, using a mirror would eradicate the need to replace parts; a simple mirror provides an elegant, reusable piece of machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            CVD diamond is nearly indistinguishable from regular diamonds, and thus have enormous tolerance to extreme temperatures and environmental conditions.
            This is perfect for traversing space, where conditions fluctuate beyond terrestrial comprehension.
            The durability that CVD diamond offers would further contribute to reusability and consequently lower costs for repeating missions.
            Not only would this help out government agencies such as NASA, improvements to solar sails could prove useful for the commercialization of space travel, an undertaking that has been repeatedly mentioned by the likes of Richard Branson or Elon Musk.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, mass producing synthetic diamonds, specifically CVD diamonds, could potentially pose a huge financial burden on manufacturers and investors.
            Nevertheless, incorporating dielectric material, namely CVD diamond, into solar sails would serve as a valuable boon to the space travel industry as well as extraterrestrial research.
