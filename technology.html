          <h2>Current Technology</h2>
          <p>
              Solar Sails work by using the way mirrors reflect incoming photons as a source of momentum in the opposite direction of the reflected photons.
              Against a thin-enough material (roughly 40 to 100 times thinner than paper), a continuous stream of photons provides sufficient propulsion for navigation.
              This idea can easily be confused with the way winds on Earth propel sailboats and ships, but the two are of significant distinction. Solar radiation,
              rather than actively pushing on a surface, exerts a pressure on it as a result of the momentum carried by incoming photons. Though relatively new to the
               world of tech, there’s no doubt that the development of solar sail technology has been a rigorous, ongoing effort in recent decades.
          </p>
          <p>
              Current solar sails are heavily dependent on how efficient their mirrors are. In other words, the more photons that a mirror can reflect, the more movement
              the payload will experience. Such efficiency is described using what is called specular reflection. Ideally, solar sails want 100% specular reflection so
              that every photon will be used toward moving the payload (i.e. “more bang for your buck”). In reality, mirrors used in solar sails have an efficiency around
              90%, so they are incapable of fully taking advantage of the solar radiation around them. This lack of efficiency is due to the mirrors’ metallic material,
              namely aluminum.
          </p>
          <p>
              Dielectric mirrors are a type of mirror composed of thin sheets of dielectric material. Dielectric material is essentially
              any electrical insulator whose molecules can be polarized by an applied electric field. The polarization of these molecules induces a displacement
              in the positive and negative charges such that they face opposite of one another. The result is an internal electric field that reduces the overall
              field within the dielectric itself. Dielectric mirrors are especially useful to solar sails because they are capable of
              achieving reflectivity well over 99.99%.
          </p>
          <p>
              Our proposed solar sail utilizes a dielectric mirror made up of synthetic CVD diamond in an effort to maintain heat resistance and structural
              integrity while increasing reflectivity. Solar sails provide a low-cost,
              long-lifespan alternative to current spacecraft, but are presently unable to function at full capacity due to limitations in current technology.

                Refractive index is a dimensionless measure of how much of the incoming light is refracted.
                Thus, for solar sails, a higher refractive index would mean more of the photons are reflected, and thus the solar sail would utilize more of the sunlight and consequently achieve a higher velocity.
                The solar spectrum of sunlight approximately spans wavelengths between .29 µm and 3.2 µm, with visible light between .39 and .70 µm (7).
                The refractive index of aluminum is around .26 at .29µm and 4.7 at 3.2µm, and the refractive index of CVD diamond is 2.47 at .29µm and 2.38 at 3.2µm (12).
                The diamond has a significantly higher refractive index, for lower wavelengths, but is outperformed by aluminum at higher wavelengths.
                Ideally, the mirror should be able to make better use of the infrared light from the sun than aluminum to maximize efficiency and pose a definite advantage over aluminum.
              </p>

                Furthermore, innovations in 3D printing technology would not only improve production speed, but cut costs for manufacturing as well.
                Lockheed Martin has already made the initiative to incorporate synthetic diamond into the process; in 2016, they reportedly filed patent applications for a diamond-printing 3D printer (9).
                Current synthesis processes for CVD diamond involves painstakingly waiting for a carbon-containing gas to decompose and for the carbon atoms to be deposited on a surface.
                It’s a long and high-effort process that could significantly benefit from improvements.
