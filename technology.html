          <h2>Current Technology</h2>
          Terraforming a planet involves the modification of its climate, atmosphere, or surface topography to make large areas hospitable toward human life. In recent years, Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, has directed his focus towards terraforming Mars. While there are numerous proposed methods, most of which would take centuries to complete, Musk has offered up his own solution: nuke Mars’ poles (O'Callaghan). The poles currently contain similar amounts of carbon dioxide and water. Thus, doing so would release large amounts of these important chemicals from the red planet’s frozen ice caps as well as huge amounts of heat, resulting in a surface temperature warm enough for liquid water to exist as well as a thickened atmosphere to keep the heat in. In theory, the subsequent ‘greenhouse’ would melt more CO2, further thickening the atmosphere, which would heat the planet more, etc (O'Callaghan). A unique advantage to this method is the lower costs as compared other proposed methods. However, this plan has several downsides. The nuclear fallout from the thermonuclear bombs would render the surface of Mars uninhabitable for any current forms of life. Additionally, nuclear clouds could absorb the sunlight and dampen the atmosphere instead of heat it.
          Other methods include introducing microorganisms that could survive on Mars and installing an orbital system of reflective mirrors to warm up the surface layers. As such, current proposed methods require advanced technology, take a long time, and may more or less be unfeasible. That is why a new method of terraforming would help speed up the colonization of Mars and other viable bodies, such as the Moon (Wagstaff).

              Instead of attempting a large scale manual terraformation of mars, which would would exhaust an enormous supply of resources, time, and money, scientists have researched how microorganisms could potentially survive and headstart the process of life. Microorganisms could transform the conditions of Earth, and could potentially transform Mars as well. However, they would need to survive on Mars. In particular, extremophiles, organisms that can survive in extreme geological and geochemical conditions, could be used for terraformation. Researchers from the University of Arkansas investigated two species of methanogens, microorganisms in the domain archaea (Djordjevic). These anaerobic organisms produce methane, and some even reduce carbon dioxide into methane using hydrogen. The two organisms used in the study,  M. formicicum and M. wolfeii, thrive in relatively high temperatures, but managed to survive the cold temperatures of Mars in laboratory tests. In 2004, methane was discovered in Mars’ atmosphere, possibly produced by methanogens. Further studies could replicate other harsh conditions on Mars to determine whether these microorganisms could actually survive on Mars.
              In 2005, a crater filled with frozen water ice was discovered near the surface of mars by the European Space Agency (Water). This introduces a new possibility of terraformation: melting the ice into water. In 2007, a study was conducted exploring the possibility of using carbon-carbon mirrors to reflect sunlight, heating the surface of Earth and eventually melting the water (Krumweide). With 300 150-meter reflective balloons, a 1.5 km wide mirror could orbit around Mars, warming its surface (Shiga). This would raise the temperature by over 80 degrees Celsius, from under -60 degrees to 20 degrees. This would not only melt bodies of ice, but if colonization were to begin, astronauts would be warmed and solar cells could generate more power. However, Mars’ thin atmosphere could cause problems by focusing low wavelength radiation, such as ultraviolet light, onto the surface.
